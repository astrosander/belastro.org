The Team competition consists of a "crossword" puzzle of 13x17 squares, where the 
answers are numbers obtained by answering astronomical questions. For example
if the question is:

How many planets in the Solar System?

the answer is "8" and the students should enter 8 into the appropriate square on
the crossword (using a computer and online software). (If a number has a decimal fraction part the decimal point is ignored, e.g. 3.14 becomes 314. In these cases the units and the required precision is given).

There are no blank squares, and the horizontal and vertical "clues" (questions) overlap so that the students do not need to answer all of them to complete the task.
There are 180 questions so that the team must work together. Some of the questions are simple, others require analysis or mathematics.
